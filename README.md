# SouthAfrican-Language-Prediction
## South African Language Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the language spoken in South Africa based on text input. The model will be trained on a dataset of South African language data and will be able to classify text as one of the 11 official languages of South Africa:

- Afrikaans
- English
= isiNdebele
- isiXhosa
- isiZulu
- Sepedi
- Sesotho
- Setswana
- siSwati
- Tshivenda
- Xitsonga


## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK


## Data

The data used to train the model will be collected from various sources and pre-processed to create a dataset of South African language text. The dataset will be split into training and test sets, with the test set reserved for evaluating the performance of the model.

## Model Training
The model will be trained using a variety of natural language processing techniques, including feature extraction, vectorization, and classification. The performance of the model will be evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy and F1 score.

## Usage
To use the trained model to predict the language of a given piece of text, you can use the predict_language function:

from language_prediction import predict_language

prediction = predict_language(text: str)
print(prediction)

The predict_language function will return the predicted language as a string.
